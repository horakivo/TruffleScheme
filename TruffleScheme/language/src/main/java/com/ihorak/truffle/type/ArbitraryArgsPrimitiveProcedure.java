/**
 * This Scheme type exist because I wanted to have seperated user define procedures from primitive ones
 * The reason behind it, is that user defined procedures will always have `numberOfArgs` specified (therefore it can be int instead of Integer)
 * Here it has to be Integer because there are primitive types (+, - ...) which take arbitrary number of args.
 * <p>
 * Another reason is that this type doesn't have any VirtualFrame parent since this procedures do NOT create a VirtualFrame (in this implementation they do unfortunately, because I can't come up with better solution right now)
